# AIVA Insurance Bot - Changelog

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### üêõ Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Name Repetition Problem**
- **Issue**: Chatbot was repeating "I'll call you [name] for our conversation" multiple times
- **Fix**: Updated prompt template to explicitly forbid this phrase repetition
- **Changes**: 
  - Added explicit instruction: "NEVER repeat 'I'll call you [name] for our conversation' - this is forbidden"
  - Modified conversation flow to use name sparingly
  - Updated greeting to be more natural

#### 2. **Email/Phone Number Validation**
- **Issue**: When only email was provided, chatbot would say "thank you" without asking for phone number
- **Fix**: Added proper validation logic for both email and phone number collection
- **Changes**:
  - Added explicit instructions for separate email and phone collection
  - Added validation requirements (email format with @ and domain, phone with 10+ digits)
  - Only shows "Thank you" message when both are provided correctly

#### 3. **Temperature Setting for Reduced Hallucinations**
- **Issue**: LLM was generating inconsistent responses due to high temperature
- **Fix**: Added temperature parameter to LLM configuration
- **Changes**:
  - Set temperature to 0.3 in `config.py` for more consistent responses
  - This reduces random variations and hallucinations
